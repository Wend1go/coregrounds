## Dependencies

Get the nwjs binaries from https://dl.nwjs.io/v0.26.6/ and extract them to the respective /apps folder.

## Development ##

For the first run, you'll need to install development dependencies by opening a shell windows, navigating to the project root and entering `npm install --dev`. You only have to do this once.

For regular development, you'll open the shell, navigate to project root and enter `npm start` to open the development app. Open another shell window, navigate to project root and enter `gulp`. You're good to go!

## Compiling ##

When done developing enter `gulp dist` to update the apps.
