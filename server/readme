==== requirements: ====
Visual Studio 2017 or later


==== install guide: ====
Everything you need is already inside of the project.
For the first installation (or when some dependencies are getting updated) follow the instructions below:

- open the sln as usual
- right click on the project boost and build (this will need some time)
- right click on the project protobuf and build (this will need some time, too)
- if any of the above build steps fail; try to build again. It should work, but might fail for some reasons.
- That's it. Try to build the server stuff as usual (press F5 or F7)
